    - Added support for abortable triggers.
    - Added named-parameters calling convention for add_trigger
    - Added new last_trigger_results method and began capturing trigger return values.

    - FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: When no triggers are called for a trigger point, the return value is now '0', not undef.

0.11  Thu Feb 22 19:02:09 PST 2007
        - Fixed a bug due to Class::Data::Inheritable, where
          triggers added to the superclass after trigger is added in
          the child class are ignored in the child class.
          See t/03_inherit.t for example.
