=head1 NAME

Class::Trigger - Mixin to add / call inheritable triggers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Foo;
  use Class::Trigger;

  sub foo {
      my $self = shift;
      $self->call_trigger('before_foo');
      # some code ...
      $self->call_trigger('middle_of_foo');
      # some code ...
      $self->call_trigger('after_foo');
  }

  package main;
  Foo->add_trigger(before_foo => \&sub1);
  Foo->add_trigger(after_foo => \&sub2);

  my $foo = Foo->new;
  $foo->foo;			# then sub1, sub2 called

  # triggers are inheritable
  package Bar;
  use base qw(Foo);

  Bar->add_trigger(before_foo => \&sub);

  # triggers can be object based
  $foo->add_trigger(after_foo => \&sub3);
  $foo->foo;			# sub3 would appply only to this object

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Class::Trigger is a mixin class to add / call triggers (or hooks)
that get called at some points you specify.

=head1 METHODS

By using this module, your class is capable of following two methods.

=over 4

=item add_trigger

  Foo->add_trigger($triggerpoint => $sub);
  $foo->add_trigger($triggerpoint => $sub);

Adds triggers for trigger point. You can have any number of triggers
for each point. Each coderef will be passed a the object reference, and
return values will be ignored.

If C<add_trigger> is called as object method, whole current trigger
table will be copied onto the object and the new trigger added to
that. (The object must be implemented as hash.)

  my $foo = Foo->new;

  # this trigger ($sub_foo) would apply only to $foo object
  $foo->add_trigger($triggerpoint => $sub_foo);
  $foo->foo;

  # And not to another $bar object
  my $bar = Foo->new;
  $bar->foo;

Any triggers added to the class after adding a trigger to an object
will not be fired for the object because the object now has a private
copy of the triggers.


=item call_trigger

  $foo->call_trigger($triggerpoint, @args);

Calls triggers for trigger point, which were added via C<add_trigger>
method. Each triggers will be passed a copy of the object as the first argument.
Remaining arguments passed to C<call_trigger> will be passed on to each trigger.
Triggers are invoked in the same order they were defined.

=back

=head1 TRIGGER POINTS

By default you can make any number of trigger points, but if you want
to declare names of trigger points explicitly, you can do it via
C<import>.

  package Foo;
  use Class::Trigger qw(foo bar baz);

  package main;
  Foo->add_trigger(foo  => \&sub1); # okay
  Foo->add_trigger(hoge => \&sub2); # exception

=over 4

=item Q.

This module lets me add subs to be run before/after a specific
subroutine is run.  Yes?

=item A.

You put various call_trigger() method in your class.  Then your class
users can call add_trigger() method to add subs to be run in points
just you specify (exactly where you put call_trigger()).

=item Q.

Are you aware of the perl-aspects project and the Aspect module?  Very
similar to Class::Trigger by the look of it, but its not nearly as
explicit.  Its not necessary for foo() to actually say "triggers go
*here*", you just add them.

=item A.

Yep ;)

But the difference with Aspect would be that Class::Trigger is so
simple that it's easy to learn, and doesn't require 5.6 or over.

=item Q.

How does this compare to Sub::Versive, or Hook::LexWrap?

=item A.

Very similar. But the difference with Class::Trigger would be the
explicitness of trigger points.

In addition, you can put hooks in any point, rather than pre or post
of a method.

=item Q.

It looks interesting, but I just can't think of a practical example of
its use...

=item A.

(by Tony Bowden)

I originally added code like this to Class::DBI to cope with one
particular case: auto-upkeep of full-text search indices.

So I added functionality in Class::DBI to be able to trigger an
arbitary subroutine every time something happened - then it was a
simple matter of setting up triggers on INSERT and UPDATE to reindex
that row, and on DELETE to remove that index row.

See L<Class::DBI::mysql::FullTextSearch> and its source code to see it
in action.
